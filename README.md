# Hi there, I'm Anastasia ðŸ‘‹
## Introduction
Welcome to Anastasia's repository. I'm a Biomedical Engineering graduate who is passionate about machine learning and data science. Here you can see some project that I developed. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, SQL, Pascal and its libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.

## ðŸ’¾ My Projects
Here are some projects that I developed in field of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and signal processing.
